## Overview 

Interface service is an application running in K8s pod on each worker node of OpenNESS K8s cluster. It allows to attach additional network interfaces of the worker host to `br-local` OVS bridge, enabling external traffic scenarios for applications deployed in K8s pods. Services on each worker can be controlled from master node using kubectl plugin.

## Traffic from external host

Machines connected to attached interface can communicate with K8s pods of the worker node (`10.16.0.0/16` subnet) through `192.168.1.1` gateway. Therefore, correct address and routing should be used. Eg:
```bash 
  ip a a 192.168.1.5/24 dev eth1
  route add -net 10.16.0.0/16 gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth1
```
> NOTE: Default OpenNESS network policy applies to pods in `default` namespace and blocks all ingress traffic. Refer to [Kubernetes NetworkPolicies](https://github.com/open-ness/specs/blob/master/doc/applications-onboard/openness_howto.md#kubernetes-networkpolicies) for example policy allowing ingress traffic from `192.168.1.0` subnet on specific port. 


## Usage

* `kubectl interfaceservice --help` to learn about usage
* `kubectl interfaceservice get <node_hostname>` to list network interfaces of node
* `kubectl interfaceservice attach <node_hostname> <pci_addr1,pci_addr2,...>` to attach interfaces to OVS br_local bridge
* `kubectl interfaceservice detach <node_hostname> <pci_addr1,pci_addr2,...>` to detach interfaces from OVS br_local bridge

> NOTE: `node_hostname` must be valid worker node name - can be found using `kubectl get nodes`

> NOTE: Invalid/non-existent PCI addreses passed to attach/detach requests will be ignored

### Example usage

```bash
  [root@master1 ~] kubectl interfaceservice get worker1
  0000:86:00.0  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d0  |  detached
  0000:86:00.1  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d1  |  detached
  0000:86:00.2  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d2  |  detached
  0000:86:00.3  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d3  |  detached


  [root@master1 ~] kubectl interfaceservice attach worker1 0000:86:00.0,0000:86:00.1,0000:86:00.4,00:123:123
  Invalid PCI address: 00:123:123. Skipping...
  Interface: 0000:86:00.4 not found. Skipping...
  Interface: 0000:86:00.0 successfully attached
  Interface: 0000:86:00.1 successfully attached


  [root@master1 ~] kubectl interfaceservice get worker1
  0000:86:00.0  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d0  |  attached
  0000:86:00.1  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d1  |  attached
  0000:86:00.2  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d2  |  detached
  0000:86:00.3  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d3  |  detached
```
